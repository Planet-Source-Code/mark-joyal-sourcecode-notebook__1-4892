## Sourcecode Notebook


</div>

### Description

This code is a Sourcecode Notebook. I needed someplace to save all the little snippits of code that I've gotten from PSC and others that Ive written myself, so here is the result. Saves the code snippit along with notes about it. Both the code window and the notes window support drag and drop of both files and text from another application. Sourcecode shows basic ADO commands, so is good for beginners or anyone not familiar with ADO. The listview control headers will sort the results of the window, and you can filter code by code type (vb, vc, perl, etc...)

Improvements from previous version: Adding ability to print code, simple searching by title, form can now be resized, various ADO SQL statement improvements, and i actually commented the code! Im trying to decide if I should make this a VB add-in even though it stores more than just VB code. What do you all think? Future realease will have bookmarking of favorites and saving of the window location and size. Also, does anyone know of a good way to implement syntax highlighting?
